#### about me
--------------------------------------------------
I became interested in programming while in art school, thanks to my
roommate for lending me his MacBook.
After learning how to draw and paint, I could write some silly programs in my free time.

I like to dig into why something is not working or perhaps working but should not be.

When given multiple choices, I try to pick the one that is rational and logical.

#### what I'm currently doing
--------------------------------------------------
> refreshing my ts/js 
> learning go
> trying to read more, currently I'm reading 1984(George Orwell)
>
